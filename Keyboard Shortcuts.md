## Firefox

### [Tridactyl]

*[Tridactyl] is a Firefox extension that makes it so you can navigate a web page with the keyboard. Shortcuts inspired by Vim.*

- Scroll Up: `j`
- Scroll Down: `k`
- Back in History: `H`
- Forward in History: `L`
- Show Links (Hint Mode): `f` (then press the key noted in red by the link you want to follow; it'll show as uppercase but that's just for visual clarity)
- Go to Text Field: `gi` (probably better to just use Hint Mode)
- Find on Page: `/`
- List Tabs: `b` (lists all open tabs and numbers them; type the number + Enter to go to it)
- Add Bookmark: `A`
- Reader Mode: `gr` (Tridactyl will stop working)

## VS Code

- Command Pallette: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
- New File: `Ctrl+N`
- Open File: `Ctrl+O`
- Open Folder: `Ctrl+Shift+O`
- Open / Hide Explorer: `Ctrl+Shift+E`
- Open / Hide Sidebar: `Ctrl+B`
- Multi-Cursor: `Ctrl+Alt+Shift` (then use the arrow keys, works like selecting)
