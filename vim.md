# Vim

Vim is a text editor. It is one of the more popular text editors because it is powerful, ancient, and it's an enhanced version of Vi, the editor installed by default on most every general purpose computing device since the 70's except the ones running Windows.

`set linebreak`

Similar to `set wrap` but doesn't break lines in the middle of a word.
